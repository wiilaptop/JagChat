# JagChat
 Python CLI-based IRC Application

This was a very small project done in my Junior year at University. JagChat has both a Client and a Server that allow for communication between one another using Python sockets.

Additional functionality is planned since I would love to one day create an app that allows for intercommunication between one another - but with charm, personality, and a focus on the communication part itself.

Client Commands:

/list = show the number of users and usernames that are currently connected to the chat room.
